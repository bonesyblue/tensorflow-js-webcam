# Smart Webcam with TensorFlow.js ðŸ“¸

### About

This project was created whilst working through the fantastic codelab: [Make a smart webcam in JavaScript with a TensorFlow.js pre-trained Machine Learning model](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection) by [@jasonmayes](https://github.com/jasonmayes)

### Getting started

```bash
yarn # Install dependencies
yarn start # Start the development server
```

Open up your favourite web-browser and head over to `localhost:8080`.

Initially, the webcam permissions button is disabled until the ML model has been loaded. Make sure to allow access to your webcam once prompted. Once everything is all set up, have fun classifying your video stream! ðŸš€

This project has been created using **webpack-cli**. To bundle your application, run:

```
yarn build
```
