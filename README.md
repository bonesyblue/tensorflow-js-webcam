# Smart Webcam with TensorFlow.js ðŸ“¸

### Getting started

```bash
yarn # Install dependencies
yarn start # Start the development server
```

Open up your favourite web-browser and head over to `localhost:8080`.

Initially, the webcam permissions button is disabled until the ML model has been loaded. Make sure to allow access to your webcam once prompted. Once everything is all set up, have fun classifying your video stream! ðŸš€
